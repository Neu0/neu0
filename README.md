# Neu0

This repository contains code for the published work at ICLR workshop 2017. The link to the article is here: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkbJrSVFe

The results of this work has been posted on http://neu0.github.io. Please do check it out.

This repository uses keras. We are working on moving this code to docker so that it can be a one time run for the public.
